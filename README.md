# Touch-Grass-Simulator
 A VR game. Remember: don't play too much. It wouldn't hurt you to go touch some grass every once in a while.
 
 ## Installation
 Installation is pretty straightforward, all you need to do is pull or download the repo and then open it in Unity. This should get most of the game working. 

Once you open the project in Unity, if models aren't showing up, go into the file tree within Unity and open each blender model in blender, then save them.
